A Computer Vision project to infer approximate wind speed and direction from flags orientation

This repo holds the git history which got too big during development. We are migrating to a [new repo](https://github.com/guglielmoG/windspeed) with no commit history but five times smaller. Refer to the new one for up-to-date content. This repository will be deleted after the migration has been enstablished.
